#  Boggle Heat Map

## Todo

* pay attention to vertex heats (directionally)
* use vertex heats to make wicked gradients
* everything is configurable (speed, whether to show gradients, etc)
* slightly nicer layout (hover over words to see them highlight on the board)
* nicer animation (leave a color trail of highlighted tiles)
* make it able to load boggle data async
* be social (twitter -- boggleheatmaps -- like button?)
* generate boggle solutions on the fly (if it takes too long, use workers + tweet/email when ready)

## Todone

* Add animations for paths (3/15/11ish)

## Info

The data was generated using the code [here](https://github.com/bantic/ruby-quiz/tree/master/boggle).
